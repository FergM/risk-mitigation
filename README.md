# Risk Mitigation
High level notes and models for investing and wealth preservation.

*The cure mustn't be worse than the disease.*

## Rolling Roughwork

### Key Metrics
* CAGR/Median/Kelly Percentiles
* **Log return** on **Total Wealth**
    * You can generalise to % of total wealth
    * Beware, nominal values matter because of affordability thresholds/step-functions baked into reality

### Visuals
From *Safe Haven Investing*:
* Bootstrap Paths Model
* X and Os Model (Sum of parts)
* Cost-Effect Safe Haven Frontier

### Industy Models:
* Portfolio Theroy Sharpe Ratio Efficient Frontier
    * Show weaknesses such as leverage fragility
    * See LML ErgodicityEconomics doc 2017

### Core Concepts
* Compound Average Grouth Rate (**CAGR / Geometric Mean**)
    * Think of risk as things which reduce CAGR.
* Kelly Criterion (Sizing your position)
    * Try to raise the lower percentile paths
* Median performance is more typical than mean performance

### Other
* Understanding **leverage**
  * Magnifies risk
  * Magnifies model error/uncertainty about risk
  * Pseudo-leverage such as 3X S&P500 ETFs, limits downside?
  * Closely related to sizing your position
* Handling **inflation** in return models
* Max log drawdown
* Falsification. Falsify hypotheses don't naively try to confirm them.
* Mechanical and Statistical Relationships. Don't confuse them. Mechanical is better but rarer.
